                <h1> Introduction </h1>
                <div>
                    <p> Individuals are the basic cell for building economic institutions, and in order to achieve this, the individual must be psychologically saturated with stability away from any work that would cause him a danger or constitute material and moral damage. This is what is known as insurance, and in the research that I am preparing and due to the complexity of its parts, Even if I am not concerned about the subject, I will address the general framework of insurance companies, with an indication of the sources of their funds, which are a source of various compensations for the interests of natural persons, public or private, as well as the importance of these companies and their relationship to the national economy.</p>
                      
                </div>

            
                <div>
                    <h3>Origin of insurance.</h3>
                    <p> Insurance was known for the first time in the European countries in the late Middle Ages, and as a result of the development of trade relations between the cities of Italy and the countries of the Mediterranean basin appeared the first area of insurance, which is maritime transport.was asking arms dealers to send their weapons by sea to supply the forces of the empire, to include the value of these weapons if lost by the enemy or because of the dangers of the sea and the idea of insurance appeared more clearly in the northern cities known as Combed and evolved little by little to take the formula Collective, At the beginning of the 16th century, insurance texts were issued, such as France's completion of maritime law with an insurance book, followed by other European countries. The first insurance company was established in the maritime field in England in 1720, followed by other European countries, so insurance became an important field of commercial and economic activity. Land insurance emerged in the 17th century as the fire guard in England following the famous Benden Fire of 1966. From it, insurance entered many other fields, especially after the spread of industry and other mechanical machinery. But insurance did not appear as it is until the beginning of the current century with the issuance of a set of laws in Aruba such as Switzerland 1908 - Germany 1908 - France 1990 and prevailed in Algeria in 1980 in accordance with Law No. 80-07 of 09/08/1980.  </p>

                <div>
                    <h3>The concept of insurance.</h3>
                    <p>It is a contract that obliges the insurer to compensate the insured as a result of the risks that occur to him in exchange for the latter's payment of periodic amounts called premiums. The Algerian insurance project is also defined as "a contract under which the insurer undertakes to pay the insured income or any other financial compensation in the event of an accident or the realization of the risk set forth in the contract, in return for a premium or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.
                    </p>
                </div>


                <div>
                    <h3>Insurance functions and types.</h3>
                    <p>The importance of insurance is due to the functions it plays in life, and the following are some important insurance functions:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Insurance reassures the soul: The insured feels through insurance the necessary protection against risks, and this is what makes him in a comfortable psychological position and be able to work safely, and gain confidence in his future. In addition, the safety resulting from insurance represents a public and social benefit, because by giving psychological security to individuals, the productivity of the individual and the institution increases, and this is reflected positively on the national economy.</li>
                            <li>Insurance is a means of capital formation: "Insurance allows by accumulating subscriptions and shares to form significant capital, so insurance is accumulating in insurance companies small amounts (if I look at them individually) that would have been consumed if not for insurance, and be an important outcome allocated to address damages when they occur." Thus, insurance represents a form of organized saving, and capital plays an important role in the development and prosperity of the national economy. Insurance companies provide the national economy and provide it with the capital that they have, by investing them in projects that benefit them to members of society, and these funds can also be given to the state or public persons in the form of loans that help achieve the goals of economic development.</li>
                            <li> Insurance is a means of insecurity: – Insurance strengthens the debtor's position towards his creditor, and guarantees the latter the fulfillment of his right in the event of the debtor's insolvency, bankruptcy or inability to work.</li>
                            <li>To insure a protective factor: – Although the direct goal of insurance is to compensate the insured from the losses incurred to him, but insurance plays another important role indirectly, which is to prevent risks and work to reduce the incidence of accidents by knowing their causes and trying not to fall into them.</li>
                            <li>Insurance has a global function: insurance has no geographical boundaries and since risks are in the world, insurance must transcend national borders to play a factoring role, and insurance plays this role on the one hand when national insurance companies conduct insurance directly abroad through their branches in foreign countries and on the other hand through reinsurance.  </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                </div>



                <div>
                    <h3>Types of insurance.</h3>
                    <p> The diversity of insurance images dramatically until it became not confined, as insurance extends to magazines in which it did not have any role previously, and the following is a presentation of the types of insurance, which were divided into two types, the first in terms of form and the second in terms of subject. (1) I- Division of insurance in terms of form: It is intended to divide it according to the body that undertakes the insurance process, and in this regard it is also divided into two types, namely cooperative insurance (mutual) and insurance with a fixed premium. </p>
              
                        <p> Mutual Insurance (Cooperative): </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>In this type of insurance, a group of people associated with the link of interest and exposed to a certain risk, without the insured and the insured within the framework of a cooperative society that brings them together to compensate for the damages caused to one of them as a result of the insured risk and the amount to be compensated is paid from a set of subscriptions that each member of the association is obligated to pay and we mention the most important characteristics of this type of insurance as follows:  – In cooperative insurance, the status of the insured and the insured is combined in each member of the association. To secure the cooperative is characterized by solidarity among its members.
                            </li>
                        </ul>


                        <p> Fixed Premiums Insurance:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li> In this type of insurance, the insurer (insurance company) is obliged to pay the insurance amount when the insured risk is realized, in return for the fixed premiums paid by the insured. Hence, the insured is not one person, and the premium committed by the insured is fixed as the insurer is committed alone before the insured, and this type of insurance is characterized by the following characteristics: – Separation of the insured from the insured. – The premium paid by the insured is fixed, that is, it is determined at a fixed amount before the conclusion of the contract. – There is no solidarity between the insured and the insured.
                        </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p> Partition of insurance in terms of subject matter: </p>
                        <ol> - Insurance is divided in terms of subject matter into several types, namely "marine, river, air rain, private insurance, social insurance, insurance for persons and insurance for damages"
                      
                        <li> Marine, land and air insurance: This insurance is based on the nature of the risks insured against, marine insurance aims to insure the risks of maritime transport by ships, and land insurance covers the risks of land transport, while air insurance covers the risks related to air transport that aircraft may be exposed to.</li>
                    
                        <li> For private insurance and social insurance: - Private insurance means insurance carried out by a person in anticipation of a specific risk or accident expected to occur in the future, the person who performs this insurance seeks to achieve his own interest, while social insurance is a system based on achieving the public interest and is to cover the social risks to which members of the general class are exposed.</li>
                        
                        <li> Insurance against damages and insurance for persons: - This division is based on the availability or verification of the compensatory character in the insurance, if the objective of insurance is to cover the risks or financial losses caused to the financial disclosure of the insured, the insurance is insurance from damages and the insurance contract is a contract of compensation, or if the purpose of the insurance is to obtain the amount of insurance as soon as the insured is achieved and regardless of the occurrence of all or part of the damage, the insurance is insurance for persons Related to man in his life and health (1). </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Insurance from damages: – In this type of insurance, the insured risk is focused on the insured's money and not his person, and this type of insurance aims to compensate the insured for the damage that may occur as a result of the occurrence of the insured risk, that is, it has the status of compensation. – This type of insurance, in turn, is divided into two main parts: insurance of things and insurance of liability:

                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <ol>
                        <li> Goods insurance: This type of damage insurance aims to compensate the insured for the damages caused to him when the risk is achieved and in this way it does not contain any two parties, the insured and the insured, and insurance of things includes several types, including: Home insurance, fire, and money insurance from theft. Etcetera</li>
                    
                        <li> Liability insurance: This type aims to guarantee the insured against the return of others to him due to damages caused to them from the errors committed by the insured. In this case, insurance aims to compensate for the damage caused to third parties and cover the liability of the insured.</li>
                        </ol>

                       <p> Personal insurance: "This insurance relates to the person of the insured and aims to pay the insurance amount if the risk occurs, and this includes insurance of risks to which a person is exposed in his life or health, as well as happy accidents such as marriage, childbearing and others. Some of the forms of insurance for persons are life insurance, accident or injury insurance and sickness insurance.The following is a breakdown of some of the types of this insurance.

                       </p>
                        <ol>
                        <li> Life insurance: - This insurance aims to face the risk of death to which every person is exposed and at every moment, and there is no doubt that this insurance is a manifestation of foresight and precaution for the future as it is considered a credit tool from others and a means of individual savings and savings at the community level, and life insurance affects several areas, including: popular insurance, insurance for death, insurance for the state of survival, supplementary insurance... Etcetera.</li>
                        
                        <li> Insurance against accidents and injuries: In this type of insurance, the insurer is obligated (in return for a premium) to cover an accident that occurs to the insured through a sum of money that leads to the latter or to the beneficiary in the event of death.</li>

                        </ol>
                        </p>

                    <h3>Insurance Benefits:</h3>
                    <p> Insurers and others can avoid part of their capital to face the risks they bear. The specialization of some entities in the insurance process leads to the establishment of their space and increased their information on the ways in which risks can be avoided or at least reduced. Insurance leads to the accumulation of capital, and their investment in various aspects of economic publishing. Insurance agencies accumulate many statistics as a result of carrying out their work. 
                        Disadvantages of insurance: Some insurance companies rise in order to achieve profit in the result of premiums and the value of the insured risk, and on the other hand, commercial establishments add insurance premiums to the production cost, which leads to raising the goods for the final consumer. Insurance companies, motivated by more profits and evasion of insured losses, tend to formulate the insurance policy in a way that brings them closer to compliance contracts.
                        This includes arbitrary conditions and obligations, sometimes gambling is insured so that the premiums are paid without realizing the insured risk. Insurance sometimes leads to the negligence of insured individuals in avoiding the occurrence of risks to reassure them because of insurance. Insurance raises some reservations from a religious point of view, which leads to the reluctance of many citizens to enter into it.

                <div>
                    <h3>The concept and forms of insurance companies:</h3>
                    <p>Algerian insurance companies have an important role in the national economy by investing funds surplus to the necessary compensation, and this has clearly contributed to the state's economic and legal entity, in addition to the effective impact on salt and international waters. Therefore, it was obligatory for us to study both the concept of insurance companies and their forms as defined by the Algerian legislator. Insurance companies are a type of financial institution that exercises a dual role, as it is an institution that provides insurance service to those who request it, It is also financial, that is, you get money from the insured, to reinvest it in exchange for a return in which they participate, and that is either directly or indirectly, so they are insurance institutions with a dual characteristic, financial and insurance.
                        The role of insurance companies in the national economy: After insurance companies collect sufficient reserves and technical provisions to meet these obligations, they seek to maintain and develop these funds under the lowest levels of risk. A means of capital formation: Insurance is a type of saving, but it is compulsory where the insurer deducts from the insured an amount or a small part periodically through him, in exchange for obtaining the insurance amount when due. 
                        The capital is important for the insured, it represents a guarantee to fulfill their rights, which obliges the law insurance companies to invest that reserve, in order to ultimately achieve the interest of the insured and there is also importance at the level of the national economy where its development and make it flourish. Means of financing projects and investment promotion:

                            <ol>
                                <li>Insurance finances economic projects through the huge funds provided by the return from the reserves, which leads to an increase in the establishment of new economic projects and thus the creation of new jobs.</li>
                                <li> Encouraging capital investment and avoiding freezing it when businessmen want to avoid freezing part of their capital to face the various risks that bear their occurrence, by paying a certain premium to achieve a guarantee against financial losses, because the entity that does not rely on the means of insurance is forced to disable part of its capital to face these risks, which leads to the disruption of investments. </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                </div>




                <div>
                    <h3> Contribution of insurance companies to the balance of payments:</h3>
                    <p> The balance of payments recommends the financial position and economic situation of the state.The effect of insurance on the balance of payments is represented in the balance of insurance operations that are subject to a clearing process between the outgoing insurance funds and the incoming insurance funds. It should be noted that there is a country issuing the insurance service that bears annual differences that reflect the price of protection provided to it by the insuring state in these countries that import the insurance service whose receipts from the insurance service are less than their payments.

                    </p>
                </div>




                <div>
                    <h3>The role of insurance companies in the social field:</h3>
                    <p>Insurance achieves safety for the insured and also achieves prosperity in the national economy, and thus becomes a tool to increase production in society, as it leads to the preservation of the elements of production, especially labor and capital.</p>
                </div>


                <div>
                    <h3> Its effects in increasing productivity: </h3>
                    <p> Workers pay premiums to insure unemployment from their income during the boom period, this reduces purchasing power, but during periods of depression, compensation is paid to them, which increases purchasing power, and insurance contributes to solving the problem of unemployment, in addition to its ability to reduce inflation.

                    </p>
                </div>



                <div>
                    <h3> Its effects in increasing productivity: </h3>
                    <p> Insurance companies play an important role in the field of increasing production, where insurance sends reassurance and security to the worker, life insurance provides the insured or the beneficiary with an amount of money or a salary income when the insured risk arrives, because the desire to obtain safety is a basic instinctive desire for every human being and there is no doubt that insurance provides this safety to the insured. In view of the pause that is broadcast by the spirit of the insured, it achieves a general social interest, so it gives security to the insured, insurance achieves the prosperity of the national economy, It becomes a tool for increasing production in society, as it leads to the preservation of the elements of production, especially labor and capital (1). It should be noted here that the similarity of insurance systems, the risks they cover and the technical foundations on which they are based necessarily lead to the similarity of many of its rules and provisions between countries. This convergence helps the association of local insurance companies with international insurance companies, whether because they re-insure them or because they share with them the same risks that extend to more than one country.Such as shipping and transportation risks. Add to this the role of insurance in promoting the prosperity and growth of international global trade by encouraging it by insuring it. The insurance or insurance companies in particular maintain the productive force, whether human or material, during the study of the risks to which they are exposed, and aims to reduce the realization of these risks by meeting their causes and working to avoid their occurrence,  Insurance leads to the departure and dedication of supervisors of economic units to formulate productive policies in an atmosphere of safety and predictability, which leads to a high level of production efficiency. It enables insurance companies to make sound estimates of the cost of production by covering future risks that undoubtedly affect the cost of Evantage and the insurance premium is included as a cost against these risks. Finally, it provides guarantees for capital and its continuation in performing its vital role in the economy through the compensatory function performed by insurance.
